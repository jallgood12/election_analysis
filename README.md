## Project Overview
An employee, Seth, of the Colorado Board of Elections has asked for help with an election audit of a recent election. Seth wants us to:
1) Determine the total number of votes.
2) Determine total number of votes each candidate received.
3) Determine the percentage of votes each candidate won.
4) Determine a winner of the election based on popular vote. 

## Summary
The total amount of votes cast in the election is 369,711

### Candidates
  - Charles Casper Stockham (received 85,213 votes or 23.0% of the total votes)
  - Diana DeGette (Received 272,892 votes or 73.8% of the total votes)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane (Received 11,606 votes or 3.1% of the total votes)

Diana DeGette is the winner of the election.
